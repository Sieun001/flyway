# Boston Tour Guide

# Boston

Boston is one of the oldest cities in the USA, founded in 1630 by the British and the site of famous events making up the American Revolution. Today, as the capital of the state of Massachusetts, Boston is famous for its educational institutions, commercial and financial headquarters, and its iconic sporting teams. A diverse culinary scene, a host of festivals and many museums and historical attractions await the 12 million plus visitors that come to Boston each year. Easily accessible, the 4-hour train ride from New York’s Central Station is an affordable and picturesque journey.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Boston Common: America’s oldest park.
- Cambridge: The educational hub of Cambridge.
- Faneuil Hall: An exciting historical setting.
- Fenway Park: Home to the beloved Boston Redsox baseball team.
# Boston Common, Cambridge, Faneuil Hall Marketplace

# Boston Common

Explore America’s oldest park at the beginning of ‘The Freedom Trail’, a path through downtown Boston unraveling 17 different historical attractions. Connecting to the Public Gardens, the two parks create an inner-city environmental escape perfect for relaxing and watching live performances. Experience a swan pond, frog ponds, fountains, walking trails, and beautiful flowers. Regardless of season, this sanctuary is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike.

# Cambridge

Just north of Boston lies the educational hub of Cambridge, named in honor of the University of Cambridge in England. The site of Harvard University, Harvard Square hosts an array of events all year round, ranging from Earth and Planetary Science exhibitions to ‘Storied Walls: Murals of the Americas’. For the culinary connoisseurs, The Artbar in East Cambridge is a stylish combination of art and food, specialty wine and cocktails, and stunning views of the Boston skyline. Four Burgers in Central Square allows you to choose from 4 patties: beef, turkey, veggie, or wild salmon, while the fries are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

# Faneuil Hall Marketplace

Shopping and dining combine in an exciting historical setting at Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Over 100 shops, pushcarts, and artisan stalls are found amongst the historic Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, North Market, and South Market buildings. Beneath the Quincy Market glass canopies lie the most unique food offerings, while inside the biggest food hall in the New England region awaits you. Operating as a marketplace since 1742, there’s a constant stream of seasonal events and live performances to whet your appetite.
# Fenway Park


Home to the beloved Boston Red Sox baseball team, this park is more than just a baseball ground. First opened in 1912, generations of sports lovers and Boston tourists have explored its grounds or seen a baseball match being played in front of adoring fans. It’s a Boston icon, being the ground where the Red Sox first played in 1912 beating the Highlanders. Seating capacity is limited, so if you’re unable to get a ticket for a baseball match, a guided tour may be the next best option. See where Boston and baseball history has been made over the years and experience what makes Bostonians’ hearts beat.

Set in an attractive, high-ceilinged venue just south of Boston Commons, the restaurant was buzzing on the Friday night in January when we visited. There is a bar eating area (about 12 seats) and a main restaurant for about 75-100 people. The food was excellent with big portions, the service efficient rather than effusive and the only real detracting factor was the price. Two courses each, one bottle of mid-range wine and the statutory 20% or so service charge.

# Chicago Tour Guide

# Chicago

Chicago is the third-most populated city in America and the largest in the mid-west region of the country. Famous for its high-profile sporting teams, prominent jazz and soul music history, and art and culture contributions, Chicago is a large and culturally exciting city. While downtown Chicago is surrounded by high skyscrapers and observatory towers, the CBD and surrounds enjoy a laid back atmosphere with parks and the lakeside charm of Lake Michigan. Known also as ‘The Windy City’ for its breezy weather, Chicago is undisputedly the mid-west capital of culture and entertainment, shopping, live performances, museums, and fine dining.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Chicago Blues and Jazz Scene - See just about any type of music.
- Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza - And Chicago-style hot dogs.
- Chicago Sports Scene - Sporting clubs unite the Chicago town.
- John Hancock Observatory Tower - It is an iconic Chicago destination.
# Chicago Travel Guide

# Chicago Blues and Jazz Scene

Although you can head out to see just about any type of music at one of the many Chicago bars and clubs, discover how blues and jazz became part of the heart and soul of 'Chi-town'. Chicago’s blues scene emerged in the 1920s, leading to the description of Chicago as the 'sweet home' of blues. Many blues clubs celebrate this culture today. A highly rated club is Rosa’s Lounge, not only for the live performances and vibe, but it’s the home-cooked Italian meals too.

# Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza

Famous for its food and cuisine options, Chicago has developed its own unique style of pizza and hot dogs. Chicago’s signature 'deep dish' pizzas have a 3-inch crust, stuffed with cheese or tomato sauce. Popular pizza hotspots include Giordano’s, which has multiple locations specializing in authentic deep-dish pizza since 1974, and Lou Malnati’s, which uses hand-selected ingredients, exclusive sausage blends, and fresh cheese from the dairy which has supplied the restaurant since the 1960s.

# Chicago Sports Scene

Like in many American cities, sporting clubs unite the Chicago town and its people in a thrilling and patriotic way. Chicago is only one of four American cities to have a team in all five of the major national leagues: baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and soccer. The Chicago Bulls (NBA), Chicago Cubs (Baseball), and Chicago Blackhawks (hockey) have some of the largest followings in the nation and the world.
# Chicago Tour Guide

# John Hancock Observatory Tower

It’s not every day you can get skyline views spanning four states, and activities to fill a full day of your trip. The John Hancock Observatory Tower is an iconic Chicago destination for tourists boasting views of Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Located 1,000 feet above the Magnificent Mile, you’re guaranteed spectacular views, day or night. Learn more about Chicago with digital CBD tours and interactive touch screens that let you zoom in on particular sites. If heights don’t scare you, get fresh air and open-air views in the ‘highest outdoor public space’ in America at the Skywalk. To complete your experience, the Lavazza café and bar is a perfect place to sip a coffee or cocktail while taking in the world-famous views.

# The Magnificent Mile

An exclusive shopping and tourist strip, the Magnificent Mile is a 13-block stretch of Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago that runs from the Chicago River in the south to Oak Avenue in the north. Over 460 shops and 275 restaurants are situated along this block, a pretty and scenic walk through the heart of the city. While events take place all year, Christmas is a particularly beautiful time to visit with the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival and ice carving competitions. Dining options are spectacular and varied including Shaw’s Crab House, which also offers sushi-making lessons.

# Los Angeles

The sun-drenched, celebrity-filled ‘City of Angels’ is often the first city where Australian travellers embark on their American adventure, but it’s much more than just a tourist gateway. Surrounded by mountains, valleys and desert, Los Angeles is a geographically diverse city. It’s also the second-largest city in America based on population. Beaches, shopping, celebrity sightings, and a laid-back, love-life attitude make Los Angeles a must-see city for many tourists. More than just Hollywood and theme parks, take the time to explore the urban, hidden culture of Los Angeles to truly discover this Californian icon.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Beverly Hills and Hollywood: One destination for celebrity spotting.
- In-N-Out Burger: A Californian fast-food institution.
- Santa Monica and Venice Beach: Beautiful beach-side resort city.
- The Getty Centre: A welcome cultural escape to the media and celebrity focus of downtown LA.
# Beverly Hills and Hollywood


Postcode 90210 is the number one destination for celebrity spotting and admiring the luxurious lifestyle of Hollywood stars. The renowned shopping strip of Rodeo Drive will make you feel like a movie star, even if you can’t afford any of the designer brands for sale here. For a welcome change from celebrity mania, visit the Hollywood Bowl for a live performance.

# In-N-Out Burger

In-N-Out Burger is a Californian fast-food institution, although now also available in other states. Known for its simple, customisable menu, In-N-Out Burger first opened in California in 1948. The menu has developed a cult following and now offers ‘Protein Style’, ‘Animal Style’ and ‘Monkey Style’ burgers. If you have adventurous tastebuds, try the ‘Animal Style’ fries. That’s the animal style patty and sauce right on top of the fries! Photo from in-n-out.com

# Santa Monica and Venice Beach

Santa Monica is a beautiful beach-side resort city filled with surprises. The Santa Monica Pier is a bustling, historic hive of activity right by the waters of Santa Monica Bay. The 100-year-old landmark has a unique carnivalesque vibe, with a historic merry-go-round, carnival rides, and souvenirs on offer. Visit the new ocean-front park ‘Tongva’, which is a family-oriented open space perfect for beachside relaxation with music, crafts and urban food trucks.
# The Getty Centre


The Getty Centre is the campus of the J Paul Getty Museum overlooking Los Angeles city. With free admission and beautiful views, it provides a welcome cultural escape from the media and celebrity focus of downtown LA.

One of the most beautiful settings in LA for a hotel. The gardens are magnificent. The food and staff are superb. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is the remodel that took place. In my opinion, they lost the unique charm of the hotel that made it so special. It was an oasis that you could retreat to.

# New York City


The quintessential world wide tourist mecca, New York City is America’s most populous city, composed of five boroughs, located amongst one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Australian travellers cannot fly directly to New York City, but it is about a 5-hour direct flight from Los Angeles to the East Coast, serviced by various airlines. With so many natural and cultural attractions to see, you can easily spend weeks or months in the bustling capital, either on a budget or with money to spend. See the major icons or travel more underground, either way you’ll lose yourself in this giant commercial and cultural hub.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Cross the Brooklyn Bridge: One of New York’s famous architectural icons.
- Greenwich Village: A beautiful mix of residential architecture, parks, and shops.
- New York Pizza: Best and brightest offerings on the market.
- Staten Island Ferry: Amazing views and ideal photo opportunities.
# Tour Guide: New York City

# New York City Tour Guide

# Cross the Brooklyn Bridge

One of New York’s famous architectural icons, the Brooklyn Bridge provides amazing views of New York Harbour and Manhattan, and leads you to a variety of attractions in the hippest New York borough. It’s recommended that you take the pedestrian walkway to best experience the bridge and take in the sights.

# Greenwich Village

Located in the west side of lower Manhattan, you’ll discover what’s affectionately known by locals as ‘The Village or ‘West Village’, a beautiful mix of residential architecture, parks and shops. Visit historical Washington Square Park and relax amongst the live music (and squirrels!), or shop at the boutiques and cafes. Walking along the picturesque streets, you’ll feel miles away from the lights of Times Square.

# New York Pizza

Dedicate a significant portion of your New York escape to celebrating New York’s highly reputable foods - bagels, hot dogs and of course its famous pizzas. And while you’ll find numerous pizza outlets on every street corner, it’s worth researching the best and brightest places on the market. If you’re serious about your pizzas, you may choose to avoid the grease and favour the artisan, gourmet, pizza restaurants instead.

# STATEN ISLAND FERRY

Take the 25-minute free ferry from lower Manhattan to Staten Island for amazing views and ideal photo opportunities. Discover New York Harbour, the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline up close, and you’ll feel dwarfed by the magnitude of New York City’s development. Being on the water is a refreshing break from walking through the city or taking the subway, and at Staten Island various cultural attractions like museums await you. Ferries run 24 hours a day and there’s no need to book.

# TIMES SQUARE

Described accurately as ‘the crossroads of the world’, a trip to Times Square is near the top of most bucket lists. No matter what time of day you visit you will experience the lights, sounds and sensations of the city that never sleeps in full force. At night, the lights of the billboards and high-rises truly come to life like a surreal, postcard. While Broadway theatre shows, shopping and dining at Restaurant Row are all popular activities, simply people-watching and immersing yourself in this worldwide famous strip is free.

We did, and although the cookies are good, I definitely would not stand in that line again in Dec. If you are bored and have a few hours to spare, great. If you are on vacation and want to see New York, would not bother... there are many more exciting things to be doing in New York other than standing in a cookie line for hours...

# Philadelphia Travel Guide

# Philadelphia

Philadelphia in the state of Pennsylvania is the second-largest city on the East Coast of America. Colloquially known as ‘Philly’, Philadelphia is a major business and industrial centre with a strong arts and culture focus. With international cuisine, beautiful parks and outdoor monuments, nightlife, zoos and museums, Philly is full of things to see and do. The city has been rated as one of the best in the country to discover by walking. With many parks and attractions to serve as rest spots, you can easily find your way around. With 14 distinct neighbourhoods to discover and set on the banks of the Delaware River, Philadelphia is a beautiful and vibrant city for tourists.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Franklin Square: Historically designed for public recreation.
- King of Prussia Mall: The largest shopping mall in America.
- LOVE Park: Famous for its Robert Indiana Love sculpture.
- Philly Steak: One of Philadelphia’s signature dishes.
# Tour Guide: Philadelphia

# Franklin Square

Franklin Square is one of Philly’s five open spaces designed for public recreation, located in the historical downtown area with lots of family fun and activity. Managed by the National Park Service, Franklin Square is a notoriously family-friendly area. Activities include carousel rides, mini golf, picnic areas, fountain, storytelling bench, and a special burger house. The home for many special seasonal events, Franklin Square hosts the Annual Historic Philadelphia Pumpkin Fest in October and New Year Countdown.

# King of Prussia Mall

The largest shopping mall in America is in the heart of Philly, boasting over 400 stores, 7 department stores, 40 eateries, and an undeniable upscale reputation. 20% of the mall’s shoppers are tourists. With 5 different food courts to choose from, you’ll find something to suit your mood. There’s Shake Shack, Dunkin’ Donuts, Haagen-Daaz, Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Chick-fil-A, The Cheesecake Factory in the food courts that are practically a tourist destination in themselves.

# LOVE Park

Nicknamed 'Centre City', LOVE Park, JFK Plaza, is famous for its Robert Indiana LOVE sculpture. Built in 1965, the park features fountains and the iconic LOVE sculpture which was designed for America’s bicentennial celebrations in 1976. The gateway to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, LOVE Park is a place of relaxation and reflection for tourists and locals alike. As a bonus, some of the city’s top food trucks often come here, so you’re more than likely to grab a top Philly bite to eat.
# Philadelphia Tour Guide

# Philly Steak Goodness

Debuted in 1930 and one of Philadelphia’s signature dishes, Philly cheese steak is the unique sandwich made out of thinly sliced steak and melted cheese (often ‘cheese whiz’ or provolone). Locals refer to the dish simply as ‘cheese steak’ or ‘cheesesteak’. The bread used for this creation is a long, white, thin bread roll that isn’t too hard or soft. Other toppings may include peppers, ketchup, fried onions, and sautéed mushrooms. Due to the immense popularity of this cult favorite, there’s a distinct competitiveness amongst restaurants. Delassandro’s in Roxborough is perfect if you prefer your beef thinly chopped. Pat’s on Passyunk Avenue is for those who like their cheese whiz nice and gooey.

# The Liberty Bell Centre

A symbol of American independence, the Liberty Bell is an iconic Philadelphian tourist attraction. In 1776, the bell rang from Independence Tower, a historical moment in which Philadelphian residents first heard of the Declaration of Independence. The bell is visible from the street 24 hours a day and is tapped gently both on Independence Day and on Martin Luther King Day. The Centre itself is filled with graphics and stories about the bell as a symbol of freedom, and soaring glass walls offer great views of Independence Hall.

Washington’s international community is best reflected in its highly distinguished dining scene. Washington is an educational and inspirational destination for couples and families alike with many tours and trips available to incorporate recreation, exercise and the outdoors into the discovery of the city’s main sights.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Great Falls Park: A great spot to hike, picnic, kayak, rock climb, or simply enjoy the serenity.
- Natural History Museum: One of the most exciting Washington attractions.
- Washington Monument: The world’s tallest stone structure.
- White House: Take part in one of the White House events on the grounds.
# Washington D.C. Tour Guide

# Great Falls Park

To escape the main drag and crowds of the city, take a trip to Great Falls Park just over the border in Virginia. On the base of the Potomac River, it is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and a great spot to hike, picnic, kayak, rock climb or simply enjoy the serenity. Being a National Park, you can get maps of suitable trails at the information centre. The waterfalls are both spectacular and relaxing. It’s hard to believe you’re so close to the city.

# Natural History Museum

Located on the National Mall, the Natural History Museum is rated by many as one of the most exciting Washington attractions. The green-domed building is a Washington landmark which opened in 1910. With no entry charge, this museum is a brilliant family outing that will teach you about dinosaurs, gems and minerals, sea-life and the waters of the world, Ancient Egypt and much more. The live butterfly pavilion is definitely a hit for many tourists. There is an IMAX theatre and Atrium Café to break up your day of exploration and learning.

# Washington Monument

You will find the famous Washington Monument on the National Mall to the west. The obelisk-like monument is the world’s tallest stone structure and was built to commemorate George Washington, who led America in the American War of Independence. At 555 feet tall, the structure is visible from much of Washington and while you can view it for free, tickets are required to tour inside.
# White House


A trip to Washington isn’t complete without catching a glimpse of the iconic White House, where each American president has lived since John Adams in 1801. Only some floors are available to tour, and tours can be booked out in advance. There are plenty of alternatives though to stepping inside the building. Take part in one of the White House events on the grounds or simply view from afar. Even being in the vicinity of this building is enough to make you feel a part of history come alive.

Idyllic beaches and the historic Hallasan volcano make for exotic and exciting surrounds, perfect for exploring and relaxation. The island has made it into the list of the world’s new natural wonders with waterfalls, lava tubes, mountains, and beaches making it a unique and amazing Korean holiday destination.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Hyeopjae Beach: Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests.
- Jeju Island Food: Home to some unique flavors.
- Manjang Cave and Lava Tubes: A perfect spot to both cool down and explore.
- Seongsan Sunrise Festival: A festive and spirited occasion.
# Jeju Island Tour Guide

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.
# Seongsan Sunrise Festival


The Seongsan Sunrise Festival takes place at 'Sunrise Peak' (or the Seongsang Ilchulbong Peak) each New Year’s Eve. The sunrise is spectacular up here and the festival includes a night hike up to the peak, lit by lanterns. Traditional dance performances are held where participants hold hands while moving in a large circle making wishes for the new year ahead. A festive and spirited occasion, fireworks and aerobics demonstrations are also on the list!

The evening continued with a delicious family-style dinner in a cozy beer cellar, featuring pretzels, sausages, sauerkraut, schweinshaxe, pfefferschnitzel, and spätzle. We even had Bavarian music lessons, singing, and dancing, followed by watching a soccer match with the locals in the biergarten.

# Testimonial from Laurent Tonnellier, General Manager, Business North & South America, Rail Europe

Traveling by train in Germany is a unique experience, be it for the thrill of high speed, the comfort, the scenery, and last but not least because it is sustainable! Germany has a lot to offer, especially superb walking trails. My last trip was in the Black Forest. If you opt for it, don’t miss the Black Forest train ride crossing the Ravenna Bridge in Southern Germany. The one on my bucket list: the iconic Rennsteig, an ancient 105-mile trail through the Thuringian Forest and Highlands, taking you along a ridge between Hörschel (near Eisenach) to Blankenstein on the Saale River, both accessible with train stations.

# Würzburg - World Heritage and World-Class Wine


Why is the Northern Bavarian city of Würzburg so popular? It can’t be attributed solely to its scenic location alongside the Main River and the ease of getting there from Frankfurt Airport. Rather, it has everything to do with Würzburg’s unique atmosphere and a fascinating mix of culture and ambiance, of world heritage and wine festivals, of avant-garde and age-old traditions that make the city irresistible.

An absolute must-do for travel clients is a private three-hour guided tour of Würzburg’s Old Town and the Residence Palace. In this amazing baroque edifice, visitors will walk up a spectacularly beautiful staircase to the largest ceiling fresco in the world. It is not surprising that the palace and the gardens were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982.

In addition, three of Germany’s largest and most renowned wine estates are based in Würzburg, offering world-famous Franconian vintages and making the town a mandatory stop for every wine enthusiast.

# Mozartfest Würzburg: A Feast for the Senses

“A beautiful, magnificent city!” Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote these words to his wife when he visited Würzburg in 1790. It would be hard to contradict him, either then or now. For more than 100 years, the city has been celebrating this extraordinary musical genius. Since 1921, travelers from all over the world have enjoyed concerts in the majestic Imperial Hall of the Residence Palace – a UNESCO World Heritage Site – or found themselves surrounded by a beautiful night sky while listening to the composer’s “Nachtmusik“ in the Court Garden, all as part of the annual Mozartfest, for which the Residence Palace is the main venue.

But Mozart in Würzburg is more than just concerts performed in a baroque landmark hall for those already in love with classical music. The festival also offers unconventional musical formats that enable visitors to appreciate orchestral works for the first time or re-encounter their favorite pieces in new ways.

The next Mozartfest, which will take place from June 2 to July 2, 2023, will celebrate the composer’s name and legacy once again with about 80 events at 30 different locations. As always, the festival promises to be a beautiful symbiosis of music, inspiration and aesthetic experience.

Tickets (from €5 to €205) can be booked online on the Mozartfest website beginning in January 2023. Contact Mozartfest by email for special deals for tour groups, including pre-sale rights beginning November 15, 2022.

# Embrace German Nature


Two seas with vast tidal flats and fine sandy beaches, clear lakes with thousands of rivers, imposing mountains and dense forests – Germany is a true paradise for nature lovers. Three UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites, 16 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, 16 national parks and 106 nature preserves safeguard this unique treasure, while 186,000 miles of hiking trails and 47,000 miles of cycle paths allow the public in to enjoy all the life-affirming benefits.

Germany’s forests cover about one-third of the country’s total land area and serve as a filter to remove harmful carbon dioxide from the air, as well as a place for recreation. In Southwest Baden-Württemberg, the Black Forest Biosphere Reserve features a mosaic of forests, meadows and pastures, forming a unique natural landscape containing a rich variety of plant and animal species.

The North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts provide their own unique landscapes. Just off the mainland, visitors to the East Frisian Island of Juist can enjoy all the sensory pleasures – including dramatic tidal phases – of a beautiful 10-mile-long beach. The receding tide makes it possible to take a “mudflat hike” on the seabed. The adjacent Wadden Sea itself is another important habitat for countless flora and fauna. Seals can be spotted luxuriating on sandbanks, just one sign of the unity of sea and nature that so characterizes Juist. Indeed, the island aims to become climate neutral by 2030.

Thanks to a wide range of environmentally friendly accommodations, attractions and activities available throughout Germany, there are myriad opportunities for today’s eco-conscious travel clients to enjoy a sustainable vacation. Our website includes ways to encounter Germany’s great outdoors, divided into four categories: natural landscapes, hiking trails, cycling trails and spa/health resorts.

# Ambassadors of Nature

# Jennifer Tombaugh

President, Tauck

"There’s nothing quite like hiking in Germany, and I’m particularly fond of Baden-Württemberg, where my family often visited when I was a child. There is nothing like the beautiful vistas of the Black Forest, the search for mushrooms, berries or a secret hut, the smell of clean mountain air and the sound of cowbells and church bells through the meadows. Whether it is a climb to Hohenzollern Castle, an alpine descent from the Feldberg, an exploration through the woods near Traube Tonbach or a walk through the vineyards hugging the Kaiserstuhl, lacing up my boots in Germany always brings a sense of joy and excitement. Of course, it also makes the reward of Kaffee und Kuchen or a tall, cold Weißbier at the end all the better!"

With its coastal climate and pristine natural landscape, Borkum is a popular choice among tourists. In the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park, this largest of the seven East Frisian Islands is a beloved wellness escape thanks to the fresh sea air, which is low in pollen and high in iodine. Borkum’s natural treasures include the Borkum Reef, with its seal banks, as well as stunningly scenic dune landscapes, inland pastures and freshwater ponds where native orchids bloom.

# Germany’s Museum Scene: Unique Treasures on Display

Germany is the culture capital of Europe and home to no less than 6,800 museums, many of which are considered architectural landmarks. These institutions offer an unparalleled variety of themes, treasures, unique concepts, and internationally renowned collections that reveal extraordinary perspectives on life and history.

To take just two examples:

- The Pergamon Museum, located on Berlin’s Museum Island since 1930, is one of the world’s most important repositories of Asian and Near Eastern sculpture and art from over 6,000 years of human endeavor.
- The House of History in Bonn is one of the most-visited museums in Germany. Every year, some 850,000 people come to marvel at the country’s history from the post-war period to the present day.

USTOA TERRY DALE

Deutsches Auswandererhaus (the German Emigration Center) in Bremerhaven is at the top of my bucket list. The museum highlights the history of German emigration with an added focus on Americans of German descent. As a New Yorker, I’ve always appreciated learning the life stories of immigrants, so it feels like an enlightening and meaningful way to explore Bremerhaven, along with the spectacular natural scenery of its port, of course.

# German Castles and Palaces


In all regions of Germany, travelers can find historic castles, palaces, and gardens that are perfect for romantic trips, memorable tours, and magical moments. These range from UNESCO World Heritage Sites to hidden and unknown gems.

# Fasanerie Palace, Fulda

About four miles outside of the city center of Fulda, visitors can marvel at the most beautiful baroque landmark of Hesse, the Fasanerie Palace. The builder and his architects make skillful use of the location, as this ornate masterpiece is in perfect harmony with its terrain of gently rolling hills surrounded by beautiful forests. With their vintage buildings and extensive parkland, these historic grounds provide visitors with a vivid picture of how generations of the former ruling family lived here during the summer months, over hundreds of years.

# Hohenzollern Castle

Hohenzollern Castle, located between Stuttgart and Lake Constance on the edge of the Swabian Alb, is the ancestral seat of the Prussian king and assorted princes. The castle is both a place steeped in history and a living residence, as it remains under private ownership of the Swabian Royal House of the Hohenzollern. In addition to an impressive art collection and the bejeweled Prussian royal crown, visitors can enjoy concerts, an open-air cinema, exhibitions, and one of the best Christmas markets in Germany, making this beautiful castle an attractive cultural choice all year round.

# Hämelschenburg Castle

As if it came right out of a fairy tale, Hämelschenburg Castle is a gem of Weser Renaissance style set in the Weserbergland region between Hameln and Bad Pyrmont. From April through October, visitors are invited to enjoy colorful insights into the life of the nobility during the Renaissance, Baroque, and 19th-century periods, with many rooms featuring period furniture, paintings, porcelain, glassware, and weaponry. A walk through the garden leads to a mill with a waterwheel, while an adjacent café invites guests to linger over a wonderful view of the magnificent south facade of the castle.

# Imperial Castle, Cochem

The Imperial Castle in Cochem is a cut above the average historic medieval landmark – literally. Its high perch and majestic old walls overlook the scenic Mosel River Valley and invite history and culture buffs to enjoy an unforgettable afternoon. In addition to guided tours given in multiple languages, guests can come together for an authentic medieval meal on Friday and Saturday evenings. The so-called Knights’ Feast is a joyful and delicious four-hour program complete with minstrels and maids.

Travel suppliers and visitors can choose from a wide range of accommodations in the castles and palaces of Germany. For a fabulous curated selection, visit our website.

# Potsdam, Sanssouci Palace


Potsdam - Prussian palaces, royal gardens and classic art

The royal palaces and gardens of Potsdam (and elsewhere in the federal state of Brandenburg, as well as Berlin) comprise a welcoming showcase of beauty and history, a cultural landscape whose diversity and abundance compare favorably with the fanciest of French palaces found along the Loire River.

# Sanssouci Palace

Far removed from all worries: This is how Frederick the Great imagined his pleasure palace in Potsdam, and he furnished it with everything that would befit a king’s comfort. Though he planned only a few rooms specifically for himself, these were all the more exquisite due to their richly turned-out furnishings and design. Five of the 12 rooms were for guests and were constantly occupied, as Frederick loved to receive visitors at his famed table gatherings on-site in the Marble Hall. Mere steps away from such splendid rooms is a magnificent terrace where the royal guests could look out over a baroque garden.

This summer residence, built atop age-old vineyard terraces, was the favorite palace of the brilliant and cultured king. It was here that Frederick lived from April to October, when he was not at war or traveling. Today, the historic Prussian ensemble of Sanssouci Palace and Park draw visitors who display the same avid appreciation as the man who built it.

# The New Chambers and Picture Gallery

In addition to his little palace, Frederick the Great had numerous additional architectural treasures built on the vast grounds of Sanssouci Park, among them another palace for guests called the New Chambers, as well as the Picture Gallery.

# The Orangery at Sanssouci Park

Hundreds of palms, agaves, laurel and orange trees adorn the gardens at Sanssouci in the summertime. For the kings who stayed here, impressive arrays of Mediterranean plants enhanced the exclusive nature of this relaxing summer retreat. During the cold months, the delicate plants would be brought to the orangeries built to preserve them until spring. This seasonal moving of plants has been a special occasion for more than 200 years and continues to this day, when more than 1,000 potted plants make the journey twice a year, constituting quite a green spectacle.

# The New Palace

Another gem in Sanssouci Park, the New Palace, is a prime example of royal splendor in contrast to the smaller palace atop the vineyard. Inside, visitors will find magnificent banquet halls, grand galleries, royally furnished apartments and a theater that is barely visible from the outside.

Once you've done them all: Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Peninsula, Mandarin, and may be even the Aman, chances are, you'll come back here. Because it's the most Japanese of them all. Because the service is impeccable (and do splurge on the Club level room and the 19th floor lounge will become your retreat from the hustle of the big hotel). Because the quality of restaurants makes you feel bad you go out. Because they remember you here.

Far from the noisy city center, this traditional ryokan represents a real traditional experience with all the comfort of modern time. The staff is very gentle and kind, the quality of the service (inclusive meals) is superior. Spring bath area is quite small, but still adequately sized for the limited number of guests supposed to be hosted.

Upper House is probably the best (and likely most expensive) hotel in HK. The rooms are exceptionally large, which results in only a total of 70 or so rooms, much fewer than your typical hotel. This allows the staff to be extra attentive to each guest's needs.

# Montreal Travel Guide

# MONTREAL

Montreal is the largest city in the Quebec province and named after Mount Royal, the hill in the heart of the city. It’s also the second-largest city in Canada following Toronto, rich in culture and heritage. French is the official language of the city and only 56% of the population speak both English and French. Beautiful all year round, Montreal has an old-world charm that makes it a romantic and enchanting escape.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Festival Calendar: Montreal is a city of festivals.
- Montreal Cuisine: Try the popular Quebec creation 'poutine'.
- Mount Royal Park: A 200-hectare park surrounding the city.
- Old Port of Montreal: Located between the St. Lawrence River and Old Montreal.
# Montreal Travel Guide

# Festival Calendar

Montreal is a city of festivals regardless of the time of year. Domestic and international tourists flock to see the city come alive at the International Jazz Festival in June/July Canadian summer. The largest jazz festival in the world, it hosts 3,000 jazz musicians. Also in June, Les Francofolies de Montreal celebrates the French-speaking music world in a 10-day celebration. In winter, Igloofest is an electronic music festival featuring local and international DJs.

# Montreal Cuisine

Montreal has the highest number of restaurants per capita in North America, and a variety of local and international dishes. Try the popular Quebec creation ‘poutine’, which is a unique dish made of French fries, brown gravy sauce and cheese. While more of a fast food option than fine dining, poutine is native to this region and rarely recreated well in other parts of North America. Top places for poutine include Garde Manger for lobster poutine; Frite Alors for 17 different sauces; and La Banquise for 30 different poutine varieties.

# Mount Royal Park

This 200-hectare park surrounding the city’s highest peak attracts more than 3 million visitors each year! In winter the park comes alive with its own ski trail, ice skating rink and picturesque lookouts. In summer, experience the serenity of Montreal or visit the historical Roman Catholic Basilica. Enjoy the beautiful plants, flowers and lakeside relaxation in this protected park.
# Old Port of Montreal


Located between the St. Lawrence River and Old Montreal, The Old Port is a popular place for locals and tourists alike to enjoy sunny days and the warmer weather. Visit the Montreal Science Centre or the IMAX theatre, or kick back and sunbathe at the Clock Tower Beach. Enjoy outdoor restaurants and shops, or take a cruise to discover Canadian maritime history. In winter, visit the popular outdoor skating rink or watch the fireworks.

When I telephoned 2 months in advance to make our reservation, I first asked if there were any hockey teams scheduled to be in the hotel during Dec, 28 - Jan. 2, and 'Baldeep' at the front desk answered me "No, it is actually quiet during those dates". So I booked the 5 nights stay in a 1 Bedroom Suite, and...

We were three families (6 adults, 6 kids) who decided to check out a genuine "beaver tail" at the kiosk/shack in the Bytown Market. Although the omnipresent Beaver Tail franchise can be found everywhere now, there is something nostalgic and authentic about the complete Ottawa experience and having a genuine Beaver Tail.

This restaurant was rated as #2 on TripAdvisor and having never heard of it (even though it has been opened for over a decade) I decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised! A hidden gem, tapas style. Each of the 7 items we ordered was done to perfection, well presented with an impeccable mix of aromas plus friendly service. The price was reasonable considering the quality of what was offered.

Their toasted marshmallow is incredible. They also make a fantastic vanilla. Most people go for their exotic flavours of both ice cream and gelato, but if even the vanilla is fantastic, I take that as a good sign. I have a friend who told me she wasn't into ice cream, but I sent her to Ed's an she went back the next week and bought a pint for her freezer! My mouth is watering as I write this.

Simple things like having to ask for bread and drink menu 10 minutes after seating. Apps were a short list, looking for a plate to share, asked for charcuterie, told they don't have it, no alternative given.

# Vancouver Highlights

# Vancouver

Vancouver is a winter wonderland popular for ski enthusiasts and active explorers to visit during their holidays. Located in British Columbia on the western coast of Canada, Vancouver is one of the prettiest cities in the world. Snow-capped mountains, water, islands, and stunning sunsets make the city a beautiful escape all year round.

- Grouse Mountain: A must-see British Columbia family destination.
- Stanley Park: A 1,000 hectare park right in the city.
- Whistler: The largest ski area in North America and a picturesque ski town full of charm.
# Tour Guide: Vancouver

# Granville Island

Visit the shores of beautiful Granville Island, just a short trip from downtown Vancouver to experience a world of old-fashioned markets, international foods, street music, galleries, and artisan shops. Visit the water park in summer to cool off with the water pipes and slides. Or experience ‘Winteruption’, Vancouver’s arts and culture festival. Better yet, treat the tastebuds with Greek gyros or ‘magic fudge’ at Olde Worlde Fudge.

# Grouse Mountain

15 km from downtown Vancouver, Grouse Mountain is a must-see British Columbia family destination. A four-season destination, the park is an adventure escape full of gondola rides, wildlife, helicopter tours, hiking trails, and paragliding. Kids and adults alike can easily spend a full day exploring the park’s large landscape. Take the ‘screaming eagle’ chairlift for breathtaking views of Vancouver city and beyond.

# Stanley Park

A 1,000 hectare park right in the city, Stanley Park is visited by more than 8 million people a year. Take a horse-drawn tour through the park as a guide points out all the historic sites. Cycle the 8km seaside track and discover scenic water views. Ride the miniature train, visit the First Nations totem poles, and during Christmas celebrate in style on the Stanley Park Christmas Train!
# Whistler


125 km north of Vancouver lies the popular ski resort town of Whistler. Whistler is the largest ski area in North America and is a picturesque ski town full of charm. You can hire a vehicle or arrange a bus tour to explore the region depending on the season. In winter, activities are endless. Ski, snowboard, take the peak-2-peak gondola, ice-skate, bungee jump, or visit Blackcomb’s Tube Park. In summer, go jet boating, 4WD exploring, kayaking, or horseback riding. A scenic, refreshing escape for couples and families, Whistler is a one-of-a-kind alpine wonder.
