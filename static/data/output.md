I knew the hotel was ranked highly, but I did not have high expectations. Well, I was surprised. The hotel room was clean, pretty, good sized, and had good amenities. From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is available on the hotel website. You just need to go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket from the stop. There are many bus ticket booths, and they all speak English. It took about 90 minutes to get to the hotel.

The inside of the grotto is not available for the public to view so make a trip to the Silla Arts and Science Museum where you can fully explore the historical site through pictures and descriptions.

Jeju Island is a beautiful destination for honeymooners and couples located off the South Korean Coast. Idyllic beaches and the historic Hallasan volcano make for exotic and exciting surrounds, perfect for exploring and relaxation. The island has made it into the list of the world’s new natural wonders with waterfalls, lava tubes, mountains, and beaches making it a unique and amazing Korean holiday destination.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- Hyeopjae Beach: Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests.
- Jeju Island Food: Home to some unique flavors.
- Manjang Cave and Lava Tubes: A perfect spot to both cool down and explore.
- Seongsan Sunrise Festival: A festive and spirited occasion.
# Hyeopjae Beach, Jeju Island

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.
# Seongsan Sunrise Festival


The Seongsan Sunrise Festival takes place at 'Sunrise Peak' (or the Seongsang Ilchulbong Peak) each New Year’s Eve. The sunrise is spectacular up here and the festival includes a night hike up to the peak, lit by lanterns. Traditional dance performances are held where participants hold hands while moving in a large circle making wishes for the new year ahead. A festive and spirited occasion, fireworks and aerobics demonstrations are also on the list!

Upper House is probably the best (and likely most expensive) hotel in HK. The rooms are exceptionally large, which results in only a total of 70 or so rooms, much fewer than your typical hotel. This allows the staff to be extra attentive to each guest's needs.

We had two nights at Icon and enjoyed every minute of it. As an extra perk we got upgraded and stayed at 26th floor which gave us a fantastic view over the harbour. Friendly and competent staff, room very clean and with good quality bed. Very nice breakfast, lots to choose from both for those with European and Asian taste. Excellent location for sightseeing, walking distance to several attractions and with the complimentary shuttle bus offered.
