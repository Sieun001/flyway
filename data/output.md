The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature.

From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is on the hotel website. You just go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket by the stop.

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

This was an unexpected stay provided by my airline as my flight from Dallas to Hong Kong was diverted to Seoul for various reasons. The hotel whose lobby is on the 36th floor with the rooms higher was wonderful. The room was exceptional and comfortable.

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

This was an unexpected stay provided by my airline as my flight from Dallas to Hong Kong was diverted to Seoul for various reasons. The hotel whose lobby is on the 36th floor with the rooms higher was wonderful. The room was exceptional and comfortable.

From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is on the hotel website. You just go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket by the stop.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

I knew the hotel was ranked highly, but I did not have high expectations. Well, I was surprised. The hotel room was clean, pretty, good sized, and had good amenities. From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is on the hotel website. You just go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket by the stop. There are many bus ticket booths, and they all spoke English. It took about 90 minutes to get to the hotel.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

I knew the hotel was ranked highly, but I did not have high expectations. Well, I was surprised. The hotel room was clean, pretty, good sized, and had good amenities. From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is on the hotel website. You just go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket by the stop. There are many bus ticket booths, and they all spoke English. It took about 90 minutes to get to the hotel.

# Bulguksa Temple

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty. Home to many national treasures and artifacts, the temple consists of many bridge-like stairways that represent Buddha and man’s journey through life.

Seokguram Grotto is another world heritage site, an artificial stone temple on Mount Tohmasan which is regarded as the ‘representative stone temple of Korea’. Built in the 8th century, the temple contains a statue of Buddha looking out into the sea. The inside of the grotto is not available for the public to view so make a trip to the Silla Arts and Science Museum where you can fully explore the historical site through pictures and descriptions.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

I knew the hotel was ranked highly, but I did not have high expectations. Well, I was surprised. The hotel room was clean, pretty, good sized, and had good amenities. From the Seoul/Inchon airport, you can take a shuttle bus. The bus number is on the hotel website. You just go outside of the airport and buy a bus ticket by the stop. There are many bus ticket booths, and they all spoke English. It took about 90 minutes to get to the hotel.

It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty. Home to many national treasures and artifacts, the temple consists of many bridge-like stairways that represent Buddha and man’s journey through life.

Built in the 8th century, the temple contains a statue of Buddha looking out into the sea. The inside of the grotto is not available for the public to view so make a trip to the Silla Arts and Science Museum where you can fully explore the historical site through pictures and descriptions.

It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

# Bulguksa Temple

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty. Home to many national treasures and artifacts, the temple consists of many bridge-like stairways that represent Buddha and man’s journey through life. Tour the temple alone or as part of a tour of the city’s ancient sites.

Seokguram Grotto is another world heritage site, an artificial stone temple on Mount Tohmasan which is regarded as the ‘representative stone temple of Korea’. Built in the 8th century, the temple contains a statue of Buddha looking out into the sea. The inside of the grotto is not available for the public to view so make a trip to the Silla Arts and Science Museum where you can fully explore the historical site through pictures and descriptions.

# Yangdong Folk Village

Yangdong is a historic village from the Joseon Dynasty. As a Korean state for about 5 centuries, Yangdong is also a world heritage site full of Korean national treasures.

It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

Upon reading some local blogs regarding hotel buffets and wanting to treat some friends, I decided to try out the Tavolo 24 dinner buffet at this relatively new Marriott hotel in Seoul. Because of the holiday season, admission was divided into two separate time slots: admission at 5:30 & 8 PM.

# Bulguksa Temple

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty. Home to many national treasures and artifacts, the temple consists of many bridge-like stairways that represent Buddha and man’s journey through life. Tour the temple alone or as part of a tour of the city’s ancient sites.

# Seokguram Grotto

Seokguram Grotto is another world heritage site, an artificial stone temple on Mount Tohmasan which is regarded as the ‘representative stone temple of Korea’. Built in the 8th century, the temple contains a statue of Buddha looking out into the sea. The inside of the grotto is not available for the public to view so make a trip to the Silla Arts and Science Museum where you can fully explore the historical site through pictures and descriptions.

# Yangdong Folk Village

Yangdong is a historic village from the Joseon Dynasty. As a Korean state for about 5 centuries, Yangdong is also a world heritage site full of Korean national treasures. Located amongst the beautiful natural surroundings, the whole village is a heritage site. Surrounded by the beautiful Mount Seolchangsan are 160 old houses and cottages, preserved in their original state.

We have never tasted a full course Korean meal with the numerous appetizers and side dishes to savor. This was a pleasant surprise. It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

We arrived at Busan airport and took an intercity bus (60min) to Gyeongju. The hotel is about 2 km from Gyeongju intercity bus station. We took a taxi to the hotel, which cost 3000 won. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Gyeongju train station (not the KTX station). The hotel is located right at the city center, surrounded by small streets and local stalls.

It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

We arrived at Busan airport and took an intercity bus (60min) to Gyeongju. The hotel is about 2 km from Gyeongju intercity bus station. We took a taxi to the hotel, which cost 3000 won. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Gyeongju train station (not the KTX station). The hotel is located right at the city center, surrounded by small streets and local stalls. The check-in process was efficient, and the reception staff spoke reasonable English and were very helpful.

We have never tasted a full course Korean meal with the numerous appetizers and side dishes to savor. This was a pleasant surprise. It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

We arrived at Busan airport and took an intercity bus (60min) to Gyeongju. The hotel is about 2 km from Gyeongju intercity bus station. We took a taxi to the hotel, which cost 3000 won. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Gyeongju train station (not the KTX station). The hotel is located right at the city center, surrounded by small streets and local stalls. The check-in process was efficient, and the reception staff spoke reasonable English and were very helpful.

Had a local take us to Hwangnam bread for a pre-lunch snack. They make a single product. It is similar to a kolach with a red bean filling. I am not a red bean fan but most of the rest of the group really liked them. They were fresh baked, still hot and needing to cool a little.

We have never tasted a full course Korean meal with the numerous appetizers and side dishes to savor. This was a pleasant surprise. It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

Had a local take us to Hwangnam bread for a pre-lunch snack. They make a single product. It is similar to a kolach with a red bean filling. I am not a red bean fan but most of the rest of the group really liked them. They were fresh baked, still hot and needing to cool a little.

We have never tasted a full course Korean meal with the numerous appetizers and side dishes to savor. This was a pleasant surprise. It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

We have never tasted a full course Korean meal with the numerous appetizers and side dishes to savor. This was a pleasant surprise. It looks like a home run restaurant (which is always the best) as they took care to prepare the ingredients and each dish was fresh and meticulously cooked. As we have no knowledge in Korea, the owner took care to introduce each dish in English as best as he could. We truly appreciate that. The house is very cozy.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

At late summer we did a family trip to Gyeongju, and stayed at K-hotel. At night, we just walked around the hotel and found Starbucks on the road. It is located near the main road around Gyeongju and near Bomun lake road as well. A good place to relax and have coffees or teas with sweets.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

The hotel is good overall, clean, new, comfortable bed, free parking, and the receptionists are very helpful with very good English. One point to feel not good is the noise from the street. I think there is a disco (likely or similar..) next to the hotel. It makes noise till 1 or 2:00 am midnight.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

# Hyeopjae Beach

This long 9 km stretch of coastline makes for a perfect holiday. Beautiful colored seawater and surrounding forests create a sense of paradise, with plenty of other attractions nearby. Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

# Jeju Island Food

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature. The cave is formed by cooling lava and its dark, cold, narrow interior may leave you feeling a little spooked.

# Seongsan Sunrise Festival

# Seongsan Sunrise Festival

Since we went in the low season, we asked the hotel for a free upgrade. Thanks to the concierge lady :).

The hotel is good overall, clean, new, comfortable bed, free parking, and the receptionists are very helpful with very good English. One point to feel not good is the noise from the street. I think there is a disco (likely or similar..) next to the hotel. It makes noise till 1 or 2:00 am midnight.

With the 180' seaview and a balcony, there's absolutely nothing u can complain about. The room was a bit old but tidy and clean overall.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

My wife loves to see Kdrama. When she described Jeju island, I thought Jeju would be just an island with a volcano and beaches. I was wrong. Jeju is a very modern city. In fact, when we were dropped at Lotte City Hotel, I was surprised to know that the hotel is very modern and family-friendly.

Since we went in the low season, we asked the hotel for a free upgrade. Thanks to the concierge lady :).

The hotel is good overall, clean, new, comfortable bed, free parking, and the receptionists are very helpful with very good English. One point to feel not good is the noise from the street. I think there is a disco (likely or similar..) next to the hotel. It makes noise till 1 or 2:00 am midnight.

With the 180' seaview and a balcony, there's absolutely nothing u can complain about. The room was a bit old but tidy and clean overall.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

Since we went in the low season, we asked the hotel for a free upgrade. Thanks to the concierge lady :).

The hotel is good overall, clean, new, comfortable bed, free parking, and the receptionists are very helpful with very good English. One point to feel not good is the noise from the street. I think there is a disco (likely or similar..) next to the hotel. It makes noise till 1 or 2:00 am midnight.

Within 10 mins taxi ride from airport. About 20 mins walk to the famous Dongmun market. Stayed in seaview room this time. With the 180' seaview and a balcony, there's absolutely nothing u can complain about. The room was a bit old but tidy and clean overall. Too bad that I had to attend an early morning meeting, didn't have the chance to try the breakfast. Oh btw, loads of restaurant and convenient stores around the area.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature.

Within 10 mins taxi ride from airport. About 20 mins walk to the famous Dongmun market. Stayed in seaview room this time. With the 180' seaview and a balcony, there's absolutely nothing u can complain about. The room was a bit old but tidy and clean overall. Too bad that I had to attend an early morning meeting, didn't have the chance to try the breakfast. Oh btw, loads of restaurant and convenient stores around the area.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Jeju Island is home to some unique flavors, so a visit here must include some culinary exploration! Try the seaweed and sea urchin soup, raw seafood, barbecued pork from the island’s famous black pigs, and pheasant. A recommended stop is the Countryside Restaurant where you can try five-layered pork!

# Manjang Cave & Lava Tubes

A perfect spot to both cool down and explore the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the Manjang cave is over 8 km long, with 1 km of public walkway space. If you’re not scared of delving into a deep, expansive cave, you can immerse yourself deep into nature.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty.

Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

On my trip to Jeju I found this restaurant online and I was very impressed by the food quality and prices. First time, I ordered the Chicken Cajun Tacos and Beef Nachos. Heaven on a plate! Second time, I had the Chicken Cajun Burrito and the Nacho and Salsa. Loved it as well! The host is super friendly and speaks great English. His little girl is super cute and curious &lt;3.

The Bulguksa Temple encapsulates Buddhist culture and the rich history of the city. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, the temple was built in 528 A.D. during the Silla Dynasty.

Visit Hamrin Park where you’ll find the tourist sites of Hyeopjaegul Cave and Ssangyonggul Cave. Or travel to Biyangdo Island just off the coast where there are camping grounds and a secluded stretch of water.

Went there for lunch. Found this shop just about 500 meters walk from our hotel and it was also recommended in TripAdvisor. Decided to give it a go as we saw plenty of people queueing during dinner time the night before. Their pork noodle soup was clear, taste of pork and big portion indeed. Their kimchi is really tasty (we had it refill again as it was really good). For 7000won per bowl, the pork noodles were worth every penny.

On my trip to Jeju I found this restaurant online and I was very impressed by the food quality and prices. First time, I ordered the Chicken Cajun Tacos and Beef Nachos. Heaven on a plate! Second time, I had the Chicken Cajun Burrito and the Nacho and Salsa. Loved it as well! The host is super friendly and speaks great English. His little girl is super cute and curious &lt;3. I enjoyed my meal and I would definitely come back in future visits to Jeju.
